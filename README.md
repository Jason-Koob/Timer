# Timer
A basic timer.
# How It Works
This script uses both the current time and a user input time and compares the two and prints out the results. Both times are formatted to use a %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S format. Each second the time updates by getting the current time again and comparing that new time with the 'expected' time to print out the difference.
